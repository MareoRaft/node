# node
Create and save graphs and directed graphs (I'm talking about the general "graph" data structure, which consists of nodes and edges, or nodes and directed edges) through a CLI (more specifically, a REPL).

This is a relatively simple program, meant for basic usage and to showcase the creation of a REPL.

## Usage
1.  Download
2.  Go into folder
3.  `perl node.pl`
