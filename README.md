# node
Create and save graphs and directed graphs (I'm talking about the general "graph" data structure, which consists of nodes and edges, or nodes and directed edges) through a CLI (more specifically, a REPL).

This is a relatively simple program, meant for basic usage and to showcase the creation of a REPL.

### Usage
1.  Download (and if necessary, unzip)
2.  Open a terminal and `cd` into the project folder
3.  `perl node.pl`

### Features
(Typing "help" in the program will give more details)
  * add nodes or connections
  * delete nodes or connections
  * view graph
  * find nodes (unfinished feature)
  * change mode between "graph" and "directed graph"
  * undo last change
  * redo last undo
  * save graph to a file
  * load graph from a file
  * change color scheme (The "create your own color scheme" feature is unfinished, but you can choose from a list of color schemes)
